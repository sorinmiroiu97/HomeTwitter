# HomeTwitter

Small iOS & ipadOS application written in SwiftUI and Combine, that fetches twitter users and tweets using Twitter's api.
This is just a small app that showcases the usage of Twitter's api in combination with SwiftUI and Combine. The codebase makes use of the MVVM design pattern, a small custom made networking layer and a testable and clean code, having provided a few unit test files showing how to do it and how to create mock data and a mock webservice.
